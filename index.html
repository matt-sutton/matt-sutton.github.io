      <h2>Matthew Sutton</h2>

      I am a Lecturer in the school of <a href="https://www.qut.edu.au/about/our-people/academic-profiles/matt.sutton" target="_blank">mathematical sciences at QUT</a>. My research interests span broadly across Monte Carlo methods, high-dimensional statistics, and Bayesian methodology. Currently, I working on the development of continuous-time Monte Carlo methods to expedite the computation required for Bayesian inference. I am currently working on the Models and Algorithms research program for the <a href="https://research.qut.edu.au/qutcds/staff/matt-sutton/" target="_blank">center of data science</a>.
