# Research Groups

I am a member of the following research groups:

1. [ACEMS](http://acems.org.au/) (Centre of Excellence for Mathematical and Statistical frontiers)
2. [BRAG](https://bragqut.wordpress.com/) (Bayesian Research and Applications Group)

Currently I work with an amazing group of researchers at the Queensland University of Technology (QUT).

<strong>Dr. Benoit Liquet</strong> is a Professor at
Universite de Pau et Pays de l’Adour. In
addition he is affiliated with ACEMS, and
Queensland University of Technology. Throughout
his career he has focused on developing novel statistical models
for analysing: clinical, health and biological data
arising from epidemiological studies. His main research
interests have focused on model selection,
multi-state models, survival analysis, multiple testing problems,
dimension reduction methods, Bayesian analysis and big data.
More recently, his interests have moved to the field of computational
biology and the analysis of high throughput (‘OMICs’) data.

<strong>Dr. Kerrie Mengersen</strong> is a Professor at the
Queensland University of Technology and a
deputy director of ACEMS. Her interests focus on using
and develping new statistical and computational methods
to help solve complex real world problems. Her methodological
interests include Bayesian statistics, hierarchical modelling and
complex systems. Her applied interests are primarily in the areas
of health, environment and industry.
